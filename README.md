- **Consider**: Defenders from solid defensive teams
- **Focus**: Players with breakout potential

### Rounds 11+: Depth & Sleepers

## Snake Draft Pick Calculator

### Your Position: 7th
- **Round 1**: Pick 7
- **Round 2**: Pick 18 (12+6)  
- **Round 3**: Pick 19 (7)
- **Round 4**: Pick 30 (12+6)
- **Round 5**: Pick 31 (7)

### Picks Until Yours Formula:
- **Odd rounds**: Target pick - current pick
- **Even rounds**: (Total teams - target pick + 1) - current pick + remaining in round

## Emergency Contacts

### If Tool Crashes:
1. Restart: `python live_draft_tool.py`
2. Re-add taken players with `add <player>` 
3. Check status with `status`

### If API Fails:
- Tool falls back to sample data automatically
- Pre-generated rankings still available in analysis files

### Key Files Generated:
- `fpl_draft_analysis_YYYYMMDD_HHMM.json` (data file)
- `fpl_draft_analysis_YYYYMMDD_HHMM.txt` (readable summary)

## Quick Tips

### Before Your Pick:
1. `suggest <position>` for your target position
2. `compare <player1,player2>` for tough decisions  
3. `strategy` for round-specific advice

### After Each Pick (Others):
1. `add <player name>` to mark as taken
2. Check `status` to see picks until yours

### Draft Day Psychology:
- **Stay flexible** - don't reach for players
- **Value over need** early - fill needs later
- **Trust your prep** - use the analysis data
- **Track trends** - are people going heavy on certain positions?

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

‚ùå **Taking GK too early** (wait until round 6+)  
‚ùå **Reaching for your favorite players** (value matters)  
‚ùå **Ignoring bye weeks/rotation** (less relevant but still factor)  
‚ùå **Forgetting to mark players taken** (tool needs updates)  
‚ùå **Not having backup plans** (always have 2-3 targets per round)
